    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Royal Casino is the usual English name for versions of <a href="https://www.pagat.com/fishing/casino.html">Casino</a>
 in which the picture cards have a numerical value:  Jacks  11, Queens 
12, Kings 13 and Aces 1 or 14. As in other versions of Casino the aim is
 to capture cards from a layout on the table by playing a card from hand
 which matches in number a table card or the sum of several table cards.
  </p>
    <p>Although Royal Casino is not so common in Britain and North 
America, this is the usual form of Casino in some other countries. On 
this page I describe the version played in the Dominican Republic and a 
few other variants. In some versions of Royal Casino  played in Southern
 Africa, cards can be stolen from opponents' capture piles: these are 
described on the <a href="https://www.pagat.com/fishing/african_casino.html">African Casino</a>
 page. In Nordic countries the usual version of Casino (Kasino) is a 
form of Royal Casino without building: this is described on the <a href="https://www.pagat.com/fishing/nordic_casino.html">Nordic Casino</a> page. </p>
    <h2 id="dominican">Casino in the Dominican Republic</h2>
    <p>This version of Royal Casino, explained to me by  Humbernio 
Lockward, differs from the Anglo-American game in several ways. The 
restrictions on building and capturing and the scoring of sweeps is 
slightly different, and most importantly there is a change to the 
scoring when a player or team nears the target score of 21.</p>
    <h3 id="dplayers">Players and Cards</h3>
<p>In the Dominican Republic Casino is usually played by two people, but
 it is also possible for 3 or 4 to play. 4 players play in fixed   
partnerships with partners sitting across from each other. A standard 
52-card pack is used. The deal and play are counter-clockwise.</p>
<p>Kings have a capture value of 13, Queens = 12, and Jacks = 11. Number
 cards have their numerical value.  Aces count as 1 or 14 at the 
discretion of the player. This means that   an Ace can capture other 
Aces as well as any build and/or group(s) of   loose cards that equal 
14, any of which may contain 1 or more Aces. For   example: An Ace can 
capture an 8, 5, and A on the layout. 8 + 5 + 1 =   14.</p>
<h3 id="ddeal">Deal</h3>
<p>Initially four cards are dealt to each player and four separate cards
  face up to the centre of the  table. When all players have played the 
cards they were dealt, the same dealer deals four more cards to each 
player from the remaining deck and play continues. Any cards that are 
face up on the table remain in place but no more cards are dealt to the 
table. When the deck is exhausted and all cards have been played  the 
hand is scored and the turn to deal passes to the right.</p>
<h3 id="dplay">Play</h3>
<p> The player to dealer's right begins, and players play in turn anticlockwise around the table. At your turn you <strong>must</strong> play <strong>exactly one</strong> card from your hand face up to the table. This played card can be used in  three possible ways. </p>
<dl>
  <dt>Capture (<em>"Captura"</em> or <em>"Cojer"</em>)</dt>
  <dd>The played card may <strong>capture</strong> one or more face up 
cards from the table. It can capture individual cards of equal value to 
the played card and sets of cards whose values add up to the value of 
the played card, provided that these cards are not parts of any build.  
 It can also capture complete builds whose  value is equal to that of 
the played card. The played card together with the captured card or 
cards are added to the (face down) pile of cards that the player or team
 has captured.</dd>
  <dt>Build (<em>"Forma"</em>)</dt>
  <dd>The played card can be combined with a card or cards on the table, forming a pile that can only be captured as a unit. In a <strong>single build</strong>
 the capture value of the build is the sum of the capture values of the 
cards in it - for example 7+6 is a single build of 13 that can be 
captured by a King. A <strong>multiple build</strong> consists of two or
 more  cards or sets of cards with the same capture value. For example a
 multiple build of 9 could consist of 6, 3, 7, 2, 8, A (6+3=7+2=8+1=9) 
or of 9, 5, 4 or simply of two 9's. The <strong>owner</strong> of a build is the player who most recently added a card to it. Cards that are not part of any build will be referred to as <strong>loose cards</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Trail</dt>
  <dd>The played card is simply left on the table, where it can later be captured or incorporated into a build.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are several restrictions on what can be played, captured or built. </p>
<ol class="spaced">
  <li>A player who creates or adds to a build must hold a card in hand 
that is equal to the capture value of the build and keep it until either
 the build is captured or another player takes it over.  Note that in 
the four-player partnership game <strong>you cannot create or add to a build for your partner</strong>,
 even if you can prove that your partner holds a card of the value 
required to capture the build. Creating or extending a build makes you 
the owner of it, and to own a build you must hold a matching card 
yourself.</li>
  <li>The owner of a build is not allowed to trail. The player must 
either make a capture  or do some more building. If you own a build and 
no other option is available you will always be able to capture your own
 build, since you must hold a matching card.</li>
  <li> It is <strong>not</strong> possible to <strong>trail</strong> 
when playing a card that has a capture value equal to any loose card on 
the table. If the played card matches any card on the table that is not 
part of a build, then the player either capture all loose cards that 
match the loose card  or  use the played card to create or extend a 
build. However it is not compulsory to capture sets of cards that add up
 to the value of the played card. Also it is not compulsory to capture a
 build that matches the value  of the played card, unless you are the 
owner of the build and have no other matching card that can be used to 
capture it later. This rule has some slightly tricky consequences, so 
here are some examples.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The table contains K, 8, 7, 5, A and a King is played. The 
player could capture K,8,5 or K,7,5,A but that would leave a total of 8 
on the table. If the player fears that the next player has an 8 then to 
avoid the sweep the player could capture just the King, leaving the 
other four cards behind. Alternatively, if holding a second King the 
player could create a multiple build, for example of K,K,7,5,A. </li>
      <li>If a Queen is played when the table contains 7, 5, 4 it is 
possible to capture the 7+5 but not compulsory. The player may trail 
with the Queen instead to prevent the next player making a sweep with a 
Four. The trail is allowed because there is no equal card on the table.</li>
      <li>If the initial layout consists of <img src="Rules%20of%20Card%20Games%20%20Royal%20Casino_files/diamond.gif" alt="diamond">10, <img src="Rules%20of%20Card%20Games%20%20Royal%20Casino_files/club.gif" alt="club">10, <img src="Rules%20of%20Card%20Games%20%20Royal%20Casino_files/heart.gif" alt="heart">8, <img src="Rules%20of%20Card%20Games%20%20Royal%20Casino_files/heart.gif" alt="heart">6 and the first player plays the <img src="Rules%20of%20Card%20Games%20%20Royal%20Casino_files/spade.gif" alt="spade">10, <strong>both</strong> tens must be captured, even though  the next player may be able to score a sweep with an Ace.</li>
      <li>On the table there is a loose 5 with some other cards and you 
have a 5 and a 10 in your hand. If you play your 5 you don't have to 
capture the 5 from the table: instead you can create a build of 10: 5+5.</li>
      <li>Suppose that in a four-player game your partner has built 9 
(5+4) and you have one 9 in your hand. You cannot add your 9 to the 
build because then you would become the owner and you do not have 
another 9 to justify this. You do not want to capture the build leaving 
your partner with a useless 9. You can however simply trail your 9 
capturing nothing, so that your partner can later take your 9 along with
 the build. </li>
      </ol>
  </li>

<p>Cards that are left on the table although they could have been captured by the played card are known as <em>"dejado"</em> (left behind) or <em>"pisado"</em>
 (stepped on). It is customary for the opponents to point out such 
cards, especially if the player has left them behind by accident, 
perhaps not seeing a set of cards whose values added up to  the played 
card.</p>

  <li>It is possible to increase the capture value of a <strong>single</strong>
 build owned by another player by playing a new card from your hand onto
 the build and becoming the new owner. You must of course hold a card 
equal to the new capture value. For example another player owns a build 
of 7+5 on the table and you hold a 2 and an Ace: you can add your 2 to 
the build making it into a build of 14 for your Ace. * Note that you are
 <strong>not</strong> allowed to increase the value of <strong>your own</strong> build in this way (though it  is legal to increase the value of your partner's build in a partnership game).</li>
  <li>It is not possible to change the capture value of a multiple 
build. You can add further cards to a multiple build or convert a single
 build to a multiple build by adding cards, and by doing so you become 
the owner of the build if you did not already own it. When adding to a 
build to create a multiple build, at least one of the added cards must 
be the card you played from your hand on that turn.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="dsweeps">Sweeps (<em>Virados</em>)</h3>
<p>If a player captures all the cards on the table leaving it empty, this counts as a <strong>sweep</strong>,
 which potentially scores 1 point. To mark the sweep, the played card is
 placed face under  the player or team's capture pile, at right angles 
to the rest of the pile so that  the  face up card is partly visible and
 it is clear how many sweeps have been scored. </p>
<p>Sweeps of opposing players or teams cancel each other. Specifically, 
when both players in a two-player game or both teams in a four-player 
partnership game, or all players in a 3- or 4-player game without 
partners have at least one sweep, each player or team turns one of the 
face up sweep cards in their capture pile face down. After cancelling 
there will always be at least one player or team with no sweeps.</p>
<h3 id="dscoring">End of the Play and Scoring</h3>
<p>When the dealer plays the last card and the deck is empty, any cards 
that remain on the table are taken by the last player or team that made a
 capture.  This does not count as a sweep. The dealer <strong>can</strong>
 score a sweep with the very last card played if it really captures  all
 the cards that remain on the table. However, if the dealer ends the 
game by capturing just some of the cards and takes the rest of them only
 by virtue of having made the last capture this is not a sweep.</p>
<p>The scores are then calculated based on the cards each player or team
 has captured. There are scores for taking the most cards, the most 
spades, the 10 of Diamonds, the 2 of Spades, the Aces and the sweeps, as
 follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most  cards: <strong>3 points</strong></li>
  <li>Most Spades (<em>espadas</em>): <strong>1 point</strong></li>
  <li> 10 of Diamonds (<em>diez de casino</em>): <strong>2 points</strong></li>
  <li>2 of Spades (<em>dos de casino</em>): <strong>1 point</strong></li>
  <li>Each Ace: <strong>1 point</strong></li>
  <li>Each sweep that has not been cancelled: <strong>1 point</strong></li>
  </ul>
<p>So usually the total number of points available is 11 plus the number
 of sweeps. However if there is a tie for most cards or (in a 3- or 
4-player individual game) for most spades no one gets those points.</p>
<p>Each player or team starts at zero and keeps a cumulative score and 
the aim is to be first player or team to reach 21 points or more. 
However  some special rules come into force when a player or team has a 
score near to 21.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A player or team that has a score of <strong>18</strong> can <strong>only</strong> win by capturing most  cards (3 points).</li>
  <li>A player or team that has a score of <strong>19</strong> can <strong>only</strong> win by taking the 10 of Diamonds (2 points).</li>
  <li>A player or team that has a score of <strong>20</strong> can <strong>only</strong> win by capturing most Spades (1 point).</li>
  </ul>
<p>If a player or team with 18, 19 or 20 points does meet the criterion 
for winning - for example taking most spades when they had 20 points at 
the start of the hand - then they win the game automatically, 
irrespective of how many points the opponent(s) score. If they do not 
meet the criterion, then the opponents score normally.</p>
<p>A player or team with 18 or more points cannot score for sweeps, but 
can still use sweeps to cancel sweeps made by the opponent(s). So sweeps
 are still recorded and cancelled in the usual way, but if you have 
sweep cards face up at the end of play when your score is 18 or more you
 do not score anything for them.</p>
<p>For example in a two-player game where player A has 19 points and 
player B has 15, if player A takes most cards and two Aces makes two 
sweeps (or two more than player B), while player B scores most spades, <img src="Rules%20of%20Card%20Games%20%20Royal%20Casino_files/diamond.gif" alt="diamond">10, <img src="Rules%20of%20Card%20Games%20%20Royal%20Casino_files/spade.gif" alt="spade">2 and two Aces, player A scores nothing while player B scores 6 points and wins the game with 21.</p>
<p>If <strong>two</strong> players or teams are under scoring 
restrictions then the first to meet the winning criterion wins the game.
 In some cases it might be necessary to count cards to find out, for 
example, whether player A had taken the majority of cards before player B
 captured the <img src="Rules%20of%20Card%20Games%20%20Royal%20Casino_files/diamond.gif" alt="diamond">10.</p>
<p>Should it happen that more than one player reaches 21 or more points 
in the same deal and there is a tie for most points (for example if two 
players score 6 points each starting from a score of 15-15), further 
deals are played without scoring restrictions until one player or team 
has more points than the other(s) and wins.</p>
<h3 id="dvar">Variations</h3>
<p>Some players do not allow a player or team under scoring restrictions
 to record any sweeps, so sweeps achieved by their opponent(s) cannot be
 cancelled.</p>
<p>In the four-player partnership game some allow a player to create or 
augment a build for partner if it can be proved from the previous play 
that partner has a card that can capture the build. This is always the 
case when augmenting partner's build without changing its value, but it 
can also happen if partner has previously created a build  that was 
taken by another player, and partner has not subsequently played a card 
that could have captured it. When building for partner, a player must 
always announce "for partner", and this obliges the partner to keep the 
capturing card until the build is captured or changes ownership. <strong>Example.</strong>
 On the table are 4, 7, 9. Your partner plays an Ace and combines it 
with the 4 and 7 to build 12. The next player captures this build with a
 Queen. You hold a 3 but no Queen. Nevertheless you can play your 3 on 
the 9 to build 12 "for partner": you know your partner must have a 
Queen, otherwise the previous 12-build would not have been legal.</p>
<p>Joel A. Soto describes a version in which the endgame scoring 
restrictions apply when a player or team has a score of 16 or more.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A player or team that has a score of <strong>16</strong> can <strong>only</strong> score for capturing most  cards (3 points) or the 10 of Diamonds (2 points).</li>
      <li>A player or team that has a score of <strong>17</strong> can <strong>only</strong> score for capturing most  cards (3 points) or most Spades (1 point).</li>
      <li>A player or team that has a score of <strong>18</strong> can <strong>only</strong> score for capturing most  cards (3 points).</li>
      <li>A player or team that has a score of <strong>19</strong> can <strong>only</strong> score for the 10 of Diamonds (2 points).</li>
      <li>A player or team that has a score of <strong>20</strong> can <strong>only</strong> score for capturing most Spades (1 point).</li>
  </ul>
    <p>From 16 or 17 you can reach 21 in a single deal or in two stages.
 For example from 17 you can score 4 points and get to 21 immediately by
 taking most cards and most Spades, or you might take most cards on one 
deal taking you to 20 and later the most Spades to reach 21. If a player
 or team with 16 or 17 scores all the required points in one deal they 
win the game irrespective of the opponents' score. If they only score 
part of what they need, the opponents score normally and may win the 
game if they have enough points.    </p>
    <h2 id="na">Royal Casino in North America</h2>
    <p>As described in English and American books, <strong>Royal Casino</strong> differs from the ordinary game of <a href="https://www.pagat.com/fishing/casino.html">Casino</a>
 only in the use of the picture cards and Aces. Jacks have a capture 
value of 11, Queens 12, Kings 13 and Aces 1 or 14 at the discretion of 
the player. Picture cards and Aces can be used in the same way as other 
cards: they can capture, be captured and be incorporated into builds 
according to their capture values. For example, a Queen can capture a 
Five and a Seven, or an Ace can capture a King and an Ace, counting the 
capturing Ace as 14 and the captured Ace as 1. </p>
    <p>In comparison to the Dominican game described above, the differences are as follows.</p>
    <ol class="spaced" type="A">
      <li>Deal and play are clockwise.</li>
      <li>Captures are not compulsory: a card can be trailed even if 
there is an equal card on the table. However, the owner of a build is 
not allowed to trail but must build or capture.</li>
      <li>The game is often played without a score for sweeps. If sweeps
 are scored, a player or team scores for every sweep: there is no 
cancelling of sweeps between opponents.</li>
      <li>There are no restrictions on scoring when a player or team nears the target score of 21.</li>
      <li>If two or more players or teams reach the target score in the 
same hand, the points are counted in the following order of priority:
        <ol>
          <li>Most cards</li>
          <li>Most spades</li>
          <li>10 of Diamonds (big casino)</li>
          <li>2 of Spades (little casino)</li>
          <li> Aces in the order: Spades, Clubs, Hearts and Diamonds.</li>
          <li>Sweeps</li>
          </ol>
      </li>
      </ol>
    <h2 id="tuxedo">Tuxedo</h2>
    <p>Tuxedo is an American Casino variant for 2 to 6 players played with a deck of 40  <a href="https://www.pagat.com/kt5/rook.html">Rook</a>
 cards. Instead of the usual four suits these have four colours: black, 
red, green and yellow, with numeral cards running from 1 to 10 in each 
colour. (In a full Rook deck the numbers run up to 14 in each colour and
 there is an additional wild 'bird' card, but the bird and the numbers 
11-14 are not used in Tuxedo).</p>
    <p>The mechanics of the game are the same as in American Casino (or 
Royal Casino). The initial deal is four cards to each player and four to
 the table as usual, and when players have played their cards a further 
four cards each are dealt, provided that there are sufficient cards 
remaining in the deck. When there are not enough cards to do this, the 
cards are dealt out  evenly as far as they will go and the last 
remaining cards are dealt to the table. So the final deal of a hand will
 be 2 cards each with 2 players, 4 cards each with 3 players, 1 card 
each with 4 players, 3 cards each and 1 to the table with 5 players and 2
 cards each with 6 players.</p>
    <p>The scoring is different from that of normal Casino:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most cards: <strong>15 points</strong></li>
      <li>Each "<strong>orange</strong>": <strong>10 points</strong></li>
      <li>Each sweep of 4 or more cards: <strong>10 points</strong></li>
      <li>Each sweep of 3 or fewer cards: <strong>5 points</strong></li>
      <li>Each Five: <strong>5 points</strong></li>
      </ul>
    <p>An "orange" is scored when a player captures a red and a yellow 
card from the table at the same time. The "orange" must be called by the
 player in order to score. If the player forgets, another player can 
score 10 points by calling "orange". A false call of "orange" incurs a 
10 point penalty.</p>
    <p>The first player to reach 100 or more points wins the game.</p>
    <p>The collection <a href="https://www.pagat.com/goto/hoylecardgames" target="_top"> HOYLE Card Games</a>
 for Windows or Mac OS X includes a Tuxedo program adapted for a 
standard card deck reduced to 40 cards by removing the face cards.</p>
    <h2 id="hungarian">Hungarian Casino</h2>
    <p>David Kirchner reports an unusual Royal Casino variant learned 
from his grandfather who was born in 1890 in Hungary and moved to the 
USA in 1945. Rules for this game can also be found in S. Ulmann's <em>Das Buch der Familienspiele</em> (Vienna, 1892) under the name '<em>Casino en deux</em>' (Casino for two), said to be most usual in Hungary.</p>
    <p>This is a two-person game in which only three cards are dealt to 
each player each turn. Four cards are dealt to the table at the start as
 usual. There is <strong>no building</strong>.</p>
    <p> On his or her turn, a player may play number of cards in hand to
 take any card(s) or combination(s) of cards appearing on the      table
 such that the total of the cards played is equal to the total value of 
each card or combination taken. <strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A Queen on the table can be taken by playing a 9 and a 3 from hand.</li>
      <li>A 10 and a 2 on the table can be taken by playing a 7 and a 5 from hand.</li>
      <li>A player holding J, Q, A could play them all together to take a 4, 7 and King from the table (11+12+1=24=4+7+13).</li>
      </ul>
    <p>The played cards and the captured cards are added the the player's capture pile.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, a player who cannot or does not wish to capture 
can play a single card to the table. This card remains in the layout and
 can be captured by either player in a future turn.</p>
    <p> Since a player may play more than one card in a turn, it is not 
     unusual for a player to have two or three cards in hand after the
      opponent has played all cards. The player with remaining cards in 
the      hand may then play them in any order he or she chooses.</p>
    <p>If a player captures all the cards from the table, this is a 
sweep,  remembered as usual by keeping one of the cards face up in the 
player's capture pile. The player who makes the last capture takes all 
remaining cards from the table but this does not count as a sweep.</p>
    <p>The scoring as usual is 3 points for most cards, 2 points for the
 10 of Diamonds, and 1 point for most Spades, the 2 of Spades, each Ace 
and each sweep. Thus there are usually 11 points available plus any 
sweeps. However, if the cards are equally divided (26 each) the 3 points
 for cards are not awarded. </p>
    <p>The winner is the first player to reach 11 points. This usually 
happens during the second player's deal. Players mentally keep track of 
the points they have during this second deal, and the first person to 
correctly announce that he or she has reached 11 points on the basis of 
cards captured and sweeps wins the game, even if the other player has 
already reached 11 unknowingly. It is possible, though rare, for the 
game to go to a third deal if the scores is close and the cards are 
equally divided in one of the deals.</p>
    <p>The above rules are from David Kirchner. The rules in Ulmann's book are slightly different. According to Ulmann:</p>
    <ol class="spaced">
      <li>When capturing a card cor cards of a given value from the 
table, it is possible to play more than one card or disjoint set of 
cards from hand adding up to this value. For example a player holding J,
 7, 4 could play all three cards to capture a Jack (11) from the table 
since J=11 and 7+4=11.</li>
      <li>If the non-dealer is able to sweep the four cards initially 
dealt to the table, capturing them all with the first play, this sweep 
scores 2 points rather than 1.</li>
      <li>Before dealing the dealer shuffles and offers the pack to the 
non-dealer to cut. When cutting the non-dealer is allowed to look at cut
 card - the card that will become the bottom card of the deck and will 
be dealt to the dealer in the final sub-deal.</li>
      <li>Each deal is played to the end. If both players reach 11 or more points the player with more points wins.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
